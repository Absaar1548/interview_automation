# Shared Contracts (Future Use)

This directory is reserved for machine-readable contracts and shared types
between frontend and backend.

Examples:
- API schemas (OpenAPI / JSON Schema)
- WebSocket event definitions
- Shared enums and constants

Authoritative specifications currently live in:
docs/architecture/

This folder will be populated after frontend contracts stabilize.
